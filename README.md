# Zero

> **Code without footprints.**

Zero is an ephemeral IDE for macOS that creates isolated, disposable development environments.

## Features
- **Ephemeral**: Spin up, code, and vanish. No traces left locally.
- **Isolated**: Docker-based environments for perfect isolation.
- **Native**: Built with SwiftUI for a premium macOS experience.

## Getting Started
Open this folder in Xcode. It will automatically detect `Package.swift`.
